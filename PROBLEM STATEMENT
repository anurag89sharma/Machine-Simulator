Write a simulator of a Monitoring System to monitor the health of a large number of
machines based on the following description. 

a. when the program starts, it takes as input 'N' (the number of machines), 'f' (percentage
of machines that will fail every 5 seconds), and 't' (number of seconds taken by a failed machine
to recover)

b. the program provides a shell where we can enter certain commands (listed below); the
program only terminates when we enter the command 'quit'

c. your program should support the following commands: 
	(1) add_machines m_1, m2,
	(2) remove_machines m_1, m2,
	(3) is_machine_alive m_1, prints 'True', 'False', or 'machine not present', 
	(4) num_machines_alive, prints the number of machines that are alive,
	(5) failure_trend, prints a list where each element is the number of machines that were alive
	    based on a probe done every second (e.g., 27 27 25 22 27 32 shows there were 27 machines
	    alive at the 1st second, 25 at the 3rd second, etc.)

Simulation Set up:
(1) Create a directory to represent a machine
(2) Create a file named 'alive' inside a directory to indicate that the machine is alive
(3) Use a timer that goes off every 5 seconds. A thread (or a process) gets triggered once the
timer goes off, chooses N * f directories (machines) randomly and delete the 'alive' file from
them to indicate that those machines are not alive
(4) Use another timer that goes off every second and triggers a probe that checks how many
machines are alive
(5) Similarly, initiate a recovery process after every 't' seconds. The recovery process should
recreate the 'alive' file in all the failed machines.
